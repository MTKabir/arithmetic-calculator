Before every project I start first i try to figure out what is the core problem and how can i solve it . Once i know the problem and potential solution then i try to figure out whta are the technologies we can use to solve the problem and to grasp more knowledge of those technologies I read docs and videos . For example to do this project I am gonna first read those docs to set up the project environment and architecture of the project
